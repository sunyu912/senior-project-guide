# About Senior Project 

## The Goal of a Senior Project

- Build something practical that solves a problem. 
- You can do any topic using any development stacks you want.
- Finish the prototype of the project.
- Be able to show a project demo video.
- Manage and check in the code in GitHub.
- Finish a simple and brief project report.

## Class Logistics

- It is an independent study course.
- There is no regular meeting or classes.
- There will not be a course in Canvas, either.
- If you would like to chat or have questions, please email to make an appointment.

## Final Deliverables

- You need to have both the project demo video and the GitHub repo link ready in order to submit.
- Please submit the final project using this link: https://forms.gle/Hwwx5coCqG3CJjQd7
- The deadline to submit is the end of the final exam week (5:00pm on the Friday of the final exam week)
- If you need me to sign any form related with the senior project, please send it to me after you finish and submit the final project.
